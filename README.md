Nancy Freehafer emerged as the top-performing salesperson of the year. However, November marked a significant decline in her performance, suggesting a region-wide sales dip. Nancy rebounded in December, with sales increasing from $5,086.18 in November to $16,173.56 — a testament to her resilience and potential.

**Michael Neipper (North Region)**
Michael mirrored Nancy's November slump. Although not a standout performer, his consistency contributed to the North’s dominance.

Despite operating in the least-performing region, Mariya was among the top four by annual revenue. She managed more customers than her regional peers and displayed potential for leadership.

**Jan Kotas (West Region)**
Jan was the lowest-performing salesperson of the year. Apart from a brief improvement in June, his sales remained weak throughout.
